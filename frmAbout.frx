Thank you for downloading my program. This is my first attempt at a Tetris clone. It took me a day or two to make this program, which I kind of threw together. I created this program as a challenge, just to see if I could do it. Every line of code in this program was done by me, save the scrolling credits, courtesy of Dirk Rijmenants. Anyways, have fun!
